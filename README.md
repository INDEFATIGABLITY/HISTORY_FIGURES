This is a mobile app i created it basically campares users agess to famous figures from history it is educational amd both fun in my opinion . When using the app basically you need to put a certain age in the edittext but depending on the age there will be a specific historic figure that will be shown the ,ages range from thirthy two to ninety five and it basically tells you when they died.It is also educational in a way because if shows the users people who were a part of history and that helps them in a way ,also if they dont know the person the user my research on the person which matched their age

To create the i first went on to azure labs so that i can access the android studio were i will code the app. i first created a new project then i went to the activity main and the i inserted two button a textview and an edittext 
the first button i nameed button one and the second button i named it button two and button one is the Generate history and the button two is the clear button both the buttons are black and the text colour is white and the backround is a photo of Nelson Mandela i made it a full screen.Then i went to the MainActivity i first srote the privat val historicFigures which allow me to put in people and their ages eg "age to name", then you list as many people as you want and then i went on to declere my two buttons my edittext and my texview by use the val =findViewByid<>(R.id) for everthing
