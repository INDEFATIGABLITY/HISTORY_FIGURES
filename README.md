This is a mobile app i created it basically campares users agess to famous figures from history it is educational amd both fun in my opinion . When using the app basically you need to put a certain age in the edittext but depending on the age there will be a specific historic figure that will be shown the ,ages range from thirthy two to ninety five and it basically tells you when they died.It is also educational in a way because if shows the users people who were a part of history and that helps them in a way ,also if they dont know the person the user my research on the person which matched their age i call it the history app

To create the i first went on to azure labs so that i can access the android studio were i will code the app i opened the emulator and blue stacks this is were the app will run . i first created a new project then i went to the activity main and the i inserted two button a textview and an edittext and then i put the constraints on all the buttons and the textview and edittext
the first button i nameed button one and the second button i named it button two and button one is the Generate history and the button two is the clear button both the buttons are black and the text colour is white and the backround image is a photo of Nelson Mandela which i dowloaded rom the internet i made it a full screen.Then i went to the Main Activity i first srote the privat val historic Figures which allow me to put in people and their ages eg "age to name", then you list as many people as you want and then i went on to declare my two buttons my edittext and my texview by use the val =find View By id <> (R.id) for everthing after this i the had to make my generate history button work and my clear button using the set On click Listener for both of the buttons and then i used a video on youtube to do the if and else statements.The problems i faced making the was that i didnt even know where to start cause i didnt really understand the code that much which resulted in me having alot of errors but after watching some videos on youtube and a bit of tiktok i had more understanding but using tiktok was basically a wast of time .After watching the videos on youtube  errors started to disappear which was a good thing    

GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration on software development projects. It allows developers to host their code repositories, manage changes to their codebase, track issues, and collaborate with others through features like pull requests and code reviews. Essentially, GitHub provides a centralized hub for managing and sharing code among teams or the open-source community.
